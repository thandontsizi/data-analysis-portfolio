# Data Analysis Portfolio:
This repository documents my journey into data analysis through structured learning and hands-on projects. 
It focuses on building strong fundamentals, practicing core tools, and applying them to realistic analysis problems.

The goal of this portfolio is not just to show results but to show how I think, how I learn, and how I approach data problems end-to-end.

## Repository Structure:
The repository is organised into learning sections. 
Each section contains notes, commands, self-tests, and practical projects.
Key sections are:
- 00-PostgreSQL-Fundamentals/
- 01-SQL-Analysis/
- 02-Python-for-Data-Analysis/
- 03-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/
- 04-Data-Visualisation/
- 05-Capstone-Project/

## Most Learning Sections Contain a:
- README.md: concepts, objectives, and explanations.
- commands.md: tools, syntax, and commonly used commands.
- tests.md: self-assessment questions.
- projects/: applied projects for that topic.

## Each Project Contains:
- README.md: project context and goals.
- lessons-learned.md: reflections and key takeaways.
- verification.md: proof of work and validation steps.
- Relevant code or notebooks.

## Tools and Technologies:
The main tools used across this portfolio include:
- PostgreSQL (SQL).
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Jupyter notebooks.
- Git and GitHub (version control).
- Ubuntu (project structure management).

## How to Use This Repository:
If you are reviewing this repository:
- Start with any section's README to understand the scope.
- Explore projects to see applied work.
- Read lessons-learned to understand decision-making and growth.

If you are learning alongside it:
- Follow sections in order.
- Attempts tests before checking solutions.
- Focus on understanding, not speed.

## Repository/Portfolio Status:
This repository is actively maintained and expanded as I progress through new topics and projects.
