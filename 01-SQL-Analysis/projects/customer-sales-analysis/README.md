# Customer Sales Analysis Project:
## Project Overview:
This project analyses customer sales data using SQL to understand purchasing behaviour, identify high-value customers, and evaluate overall sales performance.

The focus is on using basic to intermediate SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from structured data.

## Objectives:
- Explore customer sales data.
- Calculate total and average sales values.
- Identify to-performing customers.
- Analyse sales trendsusing grouping and filtering.

## Tools Used:
- SQL.
- Relational database concepts (tables, rows, columns).

## Project Structure:
- 'queries.sql': SQL queries used for analysis.
- 'verification.md': Evidence that queries were executed successfully.
- 'lessons-learned.md': Key takeaways and reflections from the project.

## Notes:
This project is part of a broader SQL learning path within the Data Analysis Portfolio and focuses on clarity, correctness, and practical 
problem-solving rather than complex optimisation.
