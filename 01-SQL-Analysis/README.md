# SQL Analysis:
This section focuses on building strong SQL fundamentals for data analysis.
The goal is to learn how to query, filter, aggregate, and analyse data stored.

SQL is treated here as an analysis tool, not a database administration tool.

## Objectives:
By the end of this section I aim to be comfortable with;
- Writing clear and correct SQL queries.
- Extracting insights from structured datasets.
- Using aggregation and joins to answer business questions.
- Reading and understanding existing SQL queries.

## Core Concepts Covered:
- Basic SQL syntax.
- Filtering data with 'WHERE'.
- Sorting results with 'OREDER BY'.
- Aggregations using 'COUNT', 'SUM', 'AVG', 'MIN', 'MAX'.
- Grouping data with 'GROUP BY'.
- Combining tables with 'JOIN'.
- Writing readable and well-structured queries.

## How Learning Is Applied:
Learning in this section is reinforced through:
- Hands-on querying exercises.
- Self-tests to check understanding.
- Small, focused projects based on realistic datasets.

Projects prioritise clarity, correctness, and reasoning over query complexity.

## Expected Outcome:
After completing this section I should be able to:
- Translate analytical questions into SQL queries.
- Work comfortably with relational data.
- Explain what a query is doing and why.

This forms the foundation for later work in Python-based analysis and exploratory data analysis.
